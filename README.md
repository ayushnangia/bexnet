# BexNet: A Simple Neural Network Framework

BexNet is a simple and lightweight framework for building and training neural networks. This project aims to provide a clear and straightforward way to create, train, and evaluate neural networks for educational purposes and rapid prototyping.

## Features

- **Layer Abstractions:** Define and work with different types of layers.
- **Loss Functions:** Compute loss and backpropagate errors through the network.
- **Optimization:** Optimize your network with different optimization algorithms.
- **Tensor Operations:** Perform tensor operations essential for neural network computation.
- **Training Utilities:** Train your network with the provided training utilities.
- **Example Implementations:** Experiment with the provided XOR and fizzbuzz example to understand the usage of the framework.

## Directory Structure

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the package with layers, tensor, and loss modules.
- `data.py`: (Description of what data.py contains and its purpose)
